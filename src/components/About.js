        <div className="about-text">
            <p>I am currently a 3rd year BSc IT student, graduating at the end of this year. After my first year at university, I received a Golden Key 
              International Honour Society for achieving outstanding academic performance.</p>
            <p>I realised the power of technology when I was in matric waitering at a restaurant/bar. I decided to make an app that allows me to create an order list by only 
              clicking on the item buttons. The buttons can be renamed as the menu changes. No more forgetting orders or getting them wrong saved me alot of time and money!</p>
            <p>I have a passion for software development and I love the feeling when you get to look at the software you made or helped develop. 
            Together with my studies, did I do online courses on other programming languages and even tried to start my own app business. 
            I learned a lot and I believe I still have a lot to learn. I did some side jobs along with my studies, like creating apps for people and developing 
            websites and eCommerce stores in WordPress. 
            </p>
            <p>Other things I love doing include hunting, gym, being in nature and spending time with friends. </p>
