        </div>
        <div class="about-text">
            <p>I am currently a 3rd year BSc IT student, graduating at the end of this year. After my first year at university, I received a Golden Key 
              International Honour Society for achieving outstanding academic performance.</p>
            <p>I have a passion for software development and I love the feeling when you get to look at the software you made or helped develop. 
            Together with my studies, did I do online courses on other programming languages and even tried to start my own app business. 
            I learned a lot and I believe I still have a lot to learn. I did some side jobs along with my studies, like creating apps for people and developing 
            websites and eCommerce stores in WordPress. 
            </p>
            <p>Other things I love doing include hunting, gym, being in nature and spending time with friends. </p>
            <p>Where do I want to be in 10 years?</p>
            <p>Well I see myself in 10 years on MY game farm working as a remote senior software developer.</p>
